ICS4U Term Project - Finance Management Software repository
This program is created for the ICS4U 2019-2020 Fall course. Course expectation requires the development and implementation of 
  a fully-functional, industrial-grade application for a dedicated client. The program must meet curriculum expectations for
  the course as well as meet the requirements from the chosen client.

The application is a finance-management software designed for high school or early-university students to help keep track of 
  their finances, as well as develop a mental awareness for their monthly spendings and income during certain times of the year.

Manager of this project is Mr. Roller, instructor of course ICS4U.
Developers of this project are David Yin and Jackie Chen, students from the ICS4U course.
Client of this projec is Taishu Song, CRA agent mandating the requirements of a qualified finance-management application.

Project is to undergo the contemporary stages of application development, which is also a part of course expectations.
  A SDLC model is to be chosen during the course of development over a pre-planned schedule. Over the course of 6 months,
  the application will undergo alpha and beta-testing stages for quality assurance and progress tracking.
  
Each individual developer is to keep a full progress journal throughout the course of development. The journal accounts for 30% 
of final grade and must be descriptive in demonstrating development progress as well as learning processes.
